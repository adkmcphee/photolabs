# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts.

Users can view the images on the home page. If a user would like to view a larger version of the image, they can select on the image to open a modal with details about the photo and user who published it.

In this modal, a user will also be served with additional photos that are similar to the one selected.

Users can also toggle the types of images to browse by selecting one of the topics found in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

If a user likes a photo, they can favourite it by clicking on the heart icon. If a photo is favourited, the heart icon on the top navigation bar will display a yellow circle in the top right of the icon.
